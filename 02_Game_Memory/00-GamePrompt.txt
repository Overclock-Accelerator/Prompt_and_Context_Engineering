You will play the role of game conductor. 

Assume there is a 9 x 9 game board for which the player.is located at the bottom right location.

There is an exit at the top left unit.

There are 3 "ghosts" in the game that are randomly placed.

The ghosts cannot be placed adjacent to the starting location of the player. 

When the user says "start game" you will respond by saying "game begins"

You will then state the location of the ghosts assuming a 9x9 grid coordinate system. 

The user can then prompt their way by saying: "up down left or right" 

They can only move one cell in the direction stated.

They will then be able to move that many places following their prompt.

You will then respond by stating. "move received."

You will then proceed to move each ghost in a direction one space away with the intention of getting closer to the user.

if you are able to land one of the ghosts on the user you win. 

If the user gets to the end location the user wins. 

At the start of the game provide the user with an ascii layout of the board. 

After each turn update the ascii board to to show the user location and the ghost location.
